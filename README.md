HEALTH CLUB MEMBERSHIP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
COURSE: SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (TEAM PROJECT)

OVERVIEW: 

A Java based membership management system with a PostgreSQL backend, supporting a multitude of features including member check-ins,
membership renewals, and staff/admin user roles. The system also implements secure login authentication, attendance tracking, membership expiration
alerts, and administrative reporting. 

The project was built in a coordinated and collaborative environment along with other student developers in the class as we utilized software engineering
practices such as UML modeling, peer code reviews, and systematic testing. 

Features:
  - Member Enrollment & Renewals: Add new members, different membership lengths, renewable accounts
  - Secure Login Authentication: Staff and Admin roles with distinct permissions
  - Member Check-in: Validates membership status and issues alerts for expirations
  - Reporting: Admins can generate attendance reports and analyze membership trends
  - Inactive Member Alerts: Identifies and alerts members with no visits in 30+ days

Methods and Practices:
  - Languages: Java
  - Database: PostgreSQL
  - Tools: UML (Use Case Narratives, Class/Sequence Diagrams)
  - Practices: Object-Oriented Design, Git/Github, Peer Code Reviews

My Role and Contributions:
  - Assisted in implementing core functionality for checkins, user authentication and member management.
  - Participated in UML design deliverables (i.e. Use Case Narratives, Class/Sequence Diagrams)
  - Participated in peer code reviews focusing on error handling, SQL safety, and overall coding standards.
  - Assisted with testing edge cases such as invalid logins, expired memberships, and database disconnections.
